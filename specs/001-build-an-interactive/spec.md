# Feature Specification: Interactive AI Avatar Portfolio

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-interactive`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an interactive portfolio website featuring a central 3D AI avatar. The application has two main components: a 3D scene and a 2D chat interface. **3D Scene Features:** - It displays a 3D avatar loaded from a local GLB file (`/thais1.glb`). - The avatar is rendered with a holographic wireframe style, with glowing electric blue or magenta lines. - The avatar's eyes must track the user's mouse cursor movement across the screen in real-time. The eye movement should be subtle and constrained to natural limits. - The entire scene is viewed through a visual filter that emulates a 90s CRT monitor, complete with subtle scan lines, bloom, and occasional glitch effects. **2D Chat Interface Features:** - The UI is styled to look like a retro computer terminal, with chunky, beveled edges reminiscent of Windows 95. - It uses a monospaced or pixelated font. - The user can type a message in an input box and send it. - The AI's response is streamed back to the chat window with a typewriter effect. - The chat is powered by an AI that can answer questions about my professional skills and experience. The AI's knowledge base will be provided in a simple text file or string on the backend."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits the portfolio website and is greeted by a 3D AI avatar. The user can interact with the avatar by moving the mouse and using a chat interface to ask questions about the portfolio owner's skills and experience, receiving answers in a retro-themed interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** the website is loaded, **When** the user moves their mouse, **Then** the 3D avatar's eyes follow the cursor's position.
2.  **Given** the chat interface is visible, **When** the user types "What are your skills?" and sends it, **Then** the AI streams back a response detailing the owner's skills with a typewriter effect.
3.  **Given** the 3D scene is rendered, **When** the user looks at the screen, **Then** they see a visual filter that resembles a 90s CRT monitor.

### Edge Cases
- When the user's mouse leaves the browser window, the avatar's eyes should smoothly return to a default, forward-looking position.
- If the AI cannot answer a question from its knowledge base, it should return a friendly, in-character response like, "I'm sorry, that information is not in my database. Please ask something else about my creator's professional skills."
- If the 3D model (`/thais1.glb`) fails to load, the 3D scene should display a placeholder or a simplified representation, and a user-friendly error message should appear. The chat interface must remain functional.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a 3D avatar loaded from the `/thais1.glb` file.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST render the avatar with a holographic wireframe style, featuring glowing lines. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The color should be decided - electric blue or magenta?]
- **FR-003**: The avatar's eyes MUST track the user's mouse cursor in real-time within natural limits.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST apply a visual filter to the 3D scene that emulates a 90s CRT monitor, including scan lines, bloom, and glitch effects.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST present a 2D chat interface styled as a retro computer terminal with chunky, beveled edges.
- **FR-006**: The chat interface MUST use a monospaced or pixelated font. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: A specific font should be chosen].
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to type and send messages through an input box in the chat interface.
- **FR-008**: The AI's responses MUST be streamed to the chat window with a typewriter effect.
- **FR-009**: The AI chatbot MUST answer questions about the portfolio owner's professional skills and experience based on a provided knowledge base.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Avatar**: The 3D model representing the AI, including its geometry, materials, and textures.
- **ChatMessage**: A single message in the chat, containing content, a sender (user or AI), and a timestamp.
- **KnowledgeBase**: A structured or unstructured text source containing the information the AI will use to answer questions. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The format and structure of this knowledge base need to be defined.]

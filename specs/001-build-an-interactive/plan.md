# Implementation Plan: Interactive AI Avatar Portfolio

**Branch**: `001-build-an-interactive` | **Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/thaisfreis/Documentos/Workspace/meu-avatar-ai/specs/001-build-an-interactive/spec.md`

## Summary
The project is an interactive portfolio website featuring a central 3D AI avatar. The frontend, built with React and Three.js, will render a holographic avatar with CRT effects and eye-tracking. The backend will be a serverless Node.js function that uses the Gemini API to power a retro-styled chat interface, allowing users to ask questions about the portfolio owner's skills.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript, Node.js
**Primary Dependencies**: 
- Frontend: Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, `@react-three/postprocessing`
- Backend: `@google/generative-ai`
**Storage**: N/A (Knowledge base will be a local text file or string)
**Testing**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Testing strategy for frontend and backend]
**Target Platform**: Modern Web Browsers
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Performance Goals**: Smooth 60fps rendering for the 3D scene.
**Constraints**: The Gemini API key must be handled securely on the backend.
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page portfolio website.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Immersive User Experience**: The plan adheres to the retro-futuristic cyberpunk aesthetic with CRT effects, glowing elements, and a terminal-style chat.
- **II. High Performance 3D**: The use of React Three Fiber and a focus on optimization aligns with this principle.
- **III. Modular & Scalable Code**: The frontend will use reusable React components and the backend is a stateless serverless function, following this principle.
- **IV. Secure API Handling**: The plan explicitly states that the Gemini API key will be handled securely on the backend using environment variables.
- **V. Clear Project Structure**: The plan defines a clear separation between the `frontend` and `backend` directories.
